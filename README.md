// Project for COMP 380


// A software that performs on-line reservation for a hotel. Some functions of the software include search for a
room type, reserve, cancel, review, change and generate some type of reports for the managers. The
confirmation should be sent to the customer.

// Home page of an online hotel website will give the customer many options on how to set up their reservation for the hotel.


// Other pages of the online hotel website would inlucde a customer support and even a sign in page for customers to easily acccess a status of a hotel or even see saftey protocols in a hotel in case of an emergency so a person can be prepared ahead of time.
